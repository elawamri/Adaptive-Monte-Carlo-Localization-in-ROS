# Adaptive-Monte-Carlo-Localization-in-ROS
## Introduction
Monte Carlo Localization is an algorithm for robots to localize using a particle filter, Given a map of the environment, the algorithm estimates the position and orientation of a robot as it moves and senses the environment, however in this project we are using Adaptive Monte Carlo Localization in our purposes, (AMCL) dynamically adjusts the number of particles over a period of time, as the robot navigates around in a map. This adaptive process offers a significant computational advantage over MCL.
